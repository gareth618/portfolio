## ðŸ¦† Who Am I?

My name is **Iulian Oleniuc**, I'm {new Date() < new Date(new Date().getFullYear(), 2, 21) ? new Date().getFullYear() - 2003 : new Date().getFullYear() - 2002} years old, and I **just** graduated with a Master's degree in Advanced Studies in Computer Science from Alexandru Ioan Cuza University of IaÈ™i. My research focused on cryptography, specifically on **Key-Policy Attribute-Based Encryption**. I'm passionate about mathematics, science, and hip-hop culture.

Outside of university, I spend my time on algorithmic activities --- writing for InfoGenius, teaching at InfoGym, organizing FIICode, participating in NOI committees, and preparing students for competitions. I also enjoy reading Eric Schmitt and reflecting on the great thinkers of history. From time to time, I find myself doing web development, working on sites like this one. Depending on the season, I also like to go cycling or take the occasional trip.
